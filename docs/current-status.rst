Current Status
==============

Topaz implements Ruby 1.9.3.

At present, Topaz is not considered stable or tested in the real world, and is
extremely incomplete. We do not yet consider Topaz to be production ready (but
it gets closer every day!). All that said, if Topaz does run your program
correctly, it is likely to continue to work.

Topaz is untested on Windows (but we'd love to improve this!), it is tested on
OS X and Linux.

The following is a list of known missing features:

* Most of the standard library is missing.
* No threading support.
* No ``call/cc``.
* No method visibility (``private``).
* Many builtin methods are missing.
* No flip-flop support.
* No support for ``if /regex/``.
