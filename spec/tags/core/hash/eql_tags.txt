fails:Hash#eql? compares values when keys match
fails:Hash#eql? compares keys with eql? semantics
fails:Hash#eql? returns true iff other Hash has the same number of keys and each key-value pair matches

fails:Hash#eql? ignores hash class differences
fails:Hash#eql? compares keys with matching hash codes via eql?
fails:Hash#eql? compares the values in self to values in other hash
fails:Hash#eql? returns true if other Hash has the same number of keys and each key-value pair matches, even though the default-value are not same
