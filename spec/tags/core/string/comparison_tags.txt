fails:String#<=> with String returns 0 if self and other contain identical ASCII-compatible bytes in different encodings
fails:String#<=> with String does not return 0 if self and other contain identical non-ASCII-compatible bytes in different encodings
fails:String#<=> with String ignores encoding difference
fails:String#<=> with String returns 0 with identical ASCII-compatible bytes of different encodings
fails:String#<=> with String compares the indices of the encodings when the strings have identical non-ASCII-compatible bytes
fails:String#<=> uses the result of calling #to_str for comparison when #to_str is defined
fails:String#<=> uses the result of calling #<=> on its argument when #<=> is defined but #to_str is not
fails:String#<=> returns nil if argument also uses an inverse comparison for <=>
